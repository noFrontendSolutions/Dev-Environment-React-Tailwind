# react-logo-3d

---

The two animations below (2d and 3d) were both created with **react-three-fiber**. Beside creating the two animations, the project has also been a lesson in how to use **webpack** to transpile **React** code without using **create-react-app**. I've used the lessons I've learned to to build my own fullstack React development environment: [CRASSR](https://github.com/noFrontendSolutions/crassr)
